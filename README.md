# Supervised-Learning

-> About the project

This project will be focusing on training and assessing a machine learning model, keeping in mind the ultimate goal of producing an accurate and credible version of it. It will help to get the basic idea behind some selected machine learning methods and also a detailed understanding of how, why and when to use them.


-> Course Objectives
1. Clearly Understand the conceptual framework of the most commonly used prediction models
2. Apply the learnings on structured data and build a suitable model
3. Identify trends and predictions
4. Perform Model validation and Drive accuracy on predictions


-> Course Prerequisites
1. Should be familiar with basic and advanced statistical methods.
2. Basic working knowledge of Python

-> Course Content

-> Pre Work: 
1. Basics of Mathematics
2. Vector, Line, Plane & Hyperplane concept
3. Matrices
4. Functions & Differentials

-> Linear Regression

1.Linear relationship
2.Types of correlation
3.Assumptions of Linear regressions
4.Errors and Best Fit Line

->  Logistic regression
1. Logistic function & Sigmoid Curve
2. Confusion matrix – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity
3. Model evaluation

-> Classifiers
1. Measures of distance in space
2. Naïve Bayes Classifier
3. KNN Classifier

-> Support Vector Machine (SVM)
1. Hyperplanes
2. Hard vs Soft margin
3. Hinge loss
4. Kernel tricks
5. Cover’s theorem
6. Strength and weakness of SVM

-> Data Description:
 The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer
demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with
the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the
last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers,
only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the
earlier campaign.

->Learning Outcomes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Preparing the data to train a model
3. Training and making predictions using a classification model
4. Model evaluation

-> Objective:
 The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying
personal loans.
